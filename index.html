                </h3>
                <p>I used this image which I originally found in Rem Koolhaas's book "Delirious New York." It is a representation of Manhattanism, and how, seeing as Manhattan has a fixed amount of ground but a growing number of people, the density of the population is becoming larger and the city is spreading upwards to accommodate it. I tried to show this upwards movement through the explosion of stars and buildings in the sky, and created an even greater sensation of height by making the land appear as if it were floating. I have found that the term "stellar nucleosynthesis" is often used to help define Manhattanism. This term refers to how heavy elements are created within stars, and matter is pulled together to make the star denser. This is why I added stars to my interpretation of this image.</p>

                    <a href="#">Project Two</a>
                </h3>
                <p>I was browsing through one of the architecture magazines when I came across the Residential Block in Rua de Teatro by Eduardu Suoto de Moura. What I found most interesting was the use of extra line weight to define not only the ground lines, but the stair cases. Seeing as it is a central feature of this building, it makes sense to emphasize it. Some walls are similarly emphasized and brought forwards through shading. I tried to recreate this in the building I found by Herman Hertzberger, since the staircases help to define the space and certain walls are used to give it a more dynamic sense. This creates nooks where the students can eat privately within a public space. Seeing as this is so important to the Student's Restaurant, I thought that these line weights from the Residential Block in Rua de Teatro, built 20 years after the restaurant, would be perfect to help represent the design.</p>

                    <a href="#">Project Three</a>
                </h3>
                <p>I used the Bjarke Ingels Group Trysil Ski Resort diagrams as my inspiration. What caught my attention was the way they showed how they came to build their slopes through a series of steps. Each diagram they made gave a purpose for altering the slope, and therefore visually communicated the problem solving that went into building this resort. I used that to show how my cube came to be, since I started thinking about it in a more abstract manner and had to edit my thinking to react more obviously to the planes within the cube. I chose the face which I had the most trouble editing through my project, just as the Bjarke Ingels Group chose one slope to show their thinking process, and proceeded to break it down into steps. The red arrows show more clearly how and why I edited my cube face, and the yellow volumes show some important spaces that seemed necessary to highlight when I made this particular face.</p>

                    <a href="#">Project Four</a>
                </h3>
                <p> I used the Sagrada Familia cathedral as an inspiration for this project, mostly because of it's play with light. I wanted to show how stained glass windows affect lighting both inside and outside of a building. Having studied Le Corbusier's Villa Le Lac recently, I integrated a few of his techniques prevalent in Ronchamp, and simply fused the old cathedral by Antoni Gaudi with le Corbusier's work. I showed only one of the two images as my research image since the cathedral was the only building with a render, and I wanted to emphasize that play of light. </p>
